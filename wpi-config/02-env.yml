# This file is a YAML formatted file. YAML indenting is done in spaces not
# tabs, and whitespace is significant. If you don't stick to this, it will
# fail on provision

# These are your website, and their names plugins/themes they're
# located in. See the docs for how to define these, and what all the keys
# and options are
# Remember, whitespace is significant! Tabs and spaces mean different things
